# Notes App in React.js

# Notes App with Color-Coded and Persistent Storage Features
This project is a simple yet powerful notes app that allows users to create, update, and delete notes, with the added feature of saving notes to local storage for future use. Notes can be color-coded, making organization easier and more visually appealing. The app also features a responsive sidebar for easy note creation, and all notes are saved automatically, so they remain even after refreshing or closing the browser. This makes it a practical tool for managing daily tasks and reminders efficiently.
